### Commonly used parameters
#-dir	???                     # working directory (i.e. location of relevant files)
-r	dev.trg                     # target sentences file name (in this case, file name prefix)
#-rps	4                       # references per sentence
-p	params.txt              # parameter file
-m	01LOSS          # evaluation metric and its options
-maxIt	5                      # maximum MERT iterations
-ipi	100                      # number of intermediate initial points per iteration
-cmd	./SDecoder_cmd          # file containing commands to run decoder
-cmdTest	./SDecoder_cmd_test          # file containing commands to run decoder for test set
-decOut	nbest.out.predictions   # file prodcued by decoder
-dcfg	SDecoder_cfg.txt        # decoder config file
-N	12                      # size of N-best list generated each iteration
-v	1                      # verbosity level (0-2; higher value => more verbose)
-seed   12341234                # random number generator seed
-decV    1			# should decoder output be printed?
-save 0

# Notice that comments are allowed

### Other parameters (run "ZMERT -h" for default values)
#-tokref  # should the reference sentences be tokenized (NIST-style)?
#-fin     # output file for final values
#-prevIt  # previous MERT iterations from which to consider candidates (in addition to the current iteration)
#-minIt   # minimum MERT iterations before considering an early exit
#-stopIt  # number of consecutive iterations an early exit criterion must be satisfied before actually exiting
#-stopSig # value over which a weight change is "significant" (for early exit purposes)
#-save    # should MERT save intermediate config files or decoder output files? (or both? or neither?)
#-opi     # should MERT modify at most one parameter per iteration?
#-rand    # should first initial point (of first iteration) be initialized randomly?
#-decExit # return value by decoder indicating success
